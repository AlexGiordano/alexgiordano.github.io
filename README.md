Website - Music - Guitar - Mandolin

This is a frist crack at a basic website using HTML/CSS and a small amount of javascript. 

I found the following aspects particularly challenging:

  - Modals containing youtube videos linked from drop down menus (particularly getting the modal to to appear outside of the drop down in all browsers);

  - Stopping the music, when the modal is clsoed by clicking on the 'x' button or outside of the modal area;

  - Using media queries to make the site mobile friendly / 'mobile first'

  - Optimising the web site's speed (work in progress)
