Website - Music - Guitar - Mandolin

This is a frist crack at a basic website using HTML/CSS and a small amount of javascript. 

I found the following aspects particularly challenging:

  - Changing the colour of a dropdown button when hovering anywhere in the drop down menu (not just hovering over the button);
  
  - Modals containing youtube videos triggered by links in drop down menus (particularly getting the modal to appear outside of the drop down in all browsers);

  - Stopping the music/youtube video when the modal is closed by clicking the 'x' button or outside the modal area;

  - Using media queries to make the site mobile friendly/responsive and 'mobile first';

  - Optimising the web site's speed (work in progress).
